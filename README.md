explorer7 is a **wrapper library** that allows Windows 7's explorer.exe to run properly on modern Windows versions, aiming to resurrect the original Windows 7 shell experience.

**This project was forked from [Explorer7 but I won't sue you](https://github.com/Win10to7/explorer7-but-i-wont-sue-you) and not regular Explorer7. This fork follows the GPLv3 license without the extra terms that are not compliant with the GPLv3 license.**

This fork was made to add specific changes for the Ex7 option in the upcoming Windows 10 to 7 Transformation Pack update **and will not work like regular Explorer7**.

## Known issues (Milestone 2 Update 3, last modified 2026-06-07)
These issues, unless specified to have been resolved in a later Windows version, are persistent across subsequent versions of Windows from their introduction.

**MAKE SURE YOU READ THESE FIRST SO YOU ARE AWARE OF WHAT YOU ARE GETTING INTO!**

**Windows 10**
- Autoplay does not work (1507+).
- When ColorizationOptions is set to 0, system msstyles with the name "aero.msstyles" will result in the start menu and taskbar using the wrong color (1809+).
- The taskbar might overlap fullscreen applications whilst immersive shell is enabled (1507+).
- If a user has StartIsBack++ installed, it may attempt to erroneously hook the shell, causing both visual and functional issues.

**Windows 7 limitations/bugs**

All of the following are bugs or limitations within Windows 7's explorer itself, and will not be accounted for:

- Multi-monitor taskbars are not supported. These were later introduced in Windows 8 build 7779.
- It takes a few minutes for changes to the size and position of the taskbar to be written to the registry; restarting Explorer too quickly will revert these changes.
- Whilst small taskbar icons are enabled, changing the position to `Top` or `Bottom` from the properties window (NOT from dragging) will result in extra space being allocated between the taskbar and the working area.

## Installation Guide

For casual users, the **regular installation method** is listed below:

<details>
  <summary>Standard installation</summary>
  
**Pre-Requirements**
1. The explorer7 package from releases.
2. A valid Windows 7 x64 installation medium, in the same language as your system.

**How-to**
1. Mount your Windows 7 install media by double-clicking it.
2. Extract the explorer7 package to a suitable location. For example: `X:\Program Files\explorer7`, or `X:\explorer7`.
3. Run Ex7forW8.exe. The installer will ask for Windows 7 files. You can select either option for installation, provided that the installation media is mounted.
4. You should see the following dialog if the installer succeeded:
   
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09de37a8-a179-4bac-b15e-ca248e4d96f9)
   
5. After that, when you wish to switch your shell to the Windows 7 explorer, select the applicable option. You can always change back by running Ex7forW8.exe once again and selecting the "Use Windows 8 explorer" option (this is currently a misnomer, it actually reverts to your system's default shell, which in most cases is the modern explorer executable).
6. Enjoy!

If you have an unsupported explorer.exe file from another Windows release that you want to use, or your installation medium is in another language, you can try **manually patching and installing** with your own files:

<details>
  <summary>Manual Installation/Patching</summary>

**Pre-Requirements:**
1. The explorer7 package from releases.
2. [CFF Explorer](https://ntcore.com/files/CFF_Explorer.zip)
3. Valid installation medium of your choice (Windows XP x64 - Windows 7 SP1 x64).
4. [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html) unless you want to mount install.wim using DISM to extract a few files.
5. Experience with utilizing a personal computer and advanced file modification.

**Step 1 - Fetching files**

1. Mount your install media
2. Open `\sources\install.wim` using your archiver of choice (listed 2 in the pre-requirements)
3. Fetch the following files from install.wim (copy them somewhere safe): `\1\Windows\explorer.exe`, `\1\Windows\en-US\explorer.exe.mui` and `\1\Windows\System32\en-US\shell32.dll.mui`
4. Make an "en-US" folder in the folder which contains the explorer7 package. The file tree will look something like the following:
```
ex7_example/
├─ theme/
├─ en-US/
├─ ex7forw8.exe
├─ Import Me.reg
├─ README.txt
├─ wrp64.dll

```
5. Copy `shell32.dll.mui` and `explorer.exe.mui` to the `en-US` folder you've just created, and `explorer.exe` alongside `wrp64.dll`:
```
ex7_example/
├─ theme/
├─ en-US/
│  ├─ explorer.exe.mui
│  ├─ shell32.dll.mui
├─ ex7forw8.exe
├─ explorer.exe
├─ Import Me.reg
├─ README.txt
├─ wrp64.dll

```

Now you should have all of the necessary files to go onto the next step.

**Step 2 - Patching explorer.exe**

By default, explorer.exe will not use the wrapper dll, so you have to change out a few imports in the executable. Make sure you've fetched [CFF Explorer](https://ntcore.com/files/CFF_Explorer.zip) from the requirements.
1. Open CFF Explorer, drag explorer.exe into the window
2. Open the "Import Directory" folder in the left sidebar
3. Change out the imports for `SHLWAPI.DLL`, `OLE32.DLL` and (if applicable) `EXPLORERFRAME.DLL`:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21169181-fa4a-45db-9947-12fffc8ed239)

4. Save the file.

By now, you should be able to start `explorer.exe` from task manager or through other means.

## Registry options

These options are located under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced`.

| Name | Type | Description | Default Value |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Theme | REG_SZ / REG_EXPAND_SZ | Optional inactive theme override. A bare value like `"custom"` loads `Themes\custom.msstyles` next to `explorer.exe`, falling back to the legacy `Theme\custom.msstyles` folder if present; a full path loads that `.msstyles` directly. When unset, explorer7 automatically selects `aero.msstyles`, `aerodark.msstyles`, or `aerolite.msstyles`. | **automatic** |
| OrbDirectory | REG_SZ | Either the orb images directory to use under `explorer7\orbs`, or a `.orb` PE file containing bitmap resources. Directory values are relative to the installation directory. For example, `"blue"` loads from `explorer7\orbs\blue\`, `"colors\green"` loads from `explorer7\orbs\colors\green\`, `"Windows 7.orb"` loads `explorer7\Windows 7.orb`, and a full path like `C:\Themes\Windows 7.orb` is also supported. If this is not specified, explorer7 first looks for `explorer7\orbs\aero.orb` and uses it when present; otherwise the internal explorer image is used. | **default** |
| DisableComposition | REG_DWORD | When set to 1, explorer7 will act as if the Desktop Window Manager is not running. | **0** |
| ClassicTheme | REG_DWORD | When set to 1, explorer7 will use the Windows Classic theme. | **0** |
| EnableImmersive | REG_DWORD | Controls the ability to run immersive applications in the system. When set to 0, immersive applications will not be able to run. | **1** |
| StoreAppsInStart | REG_DWORD | When set to 0, immersive applications will be hidden from the All Programs list. | **1** |
| StoreAppsOnTaskbar | REG_DWORD | When set to 0, specializations applied to load immersive application icons will not be applied, and pinned immersive applications will be hidden. | **0 (when EnableImmersive = 0)**, **1 (when EnableImmersive = 1)** |
| ColorizationOptions | REG_DWORD | Controls shell colorization behaviour. Options 1 to 4 may have varying compatibility across Windows versions. | **0** |
| AcrylicColorization | REG_DWORD | Controls acrylic colorization behaviour. Options 0-2 control the use of immersive colours, option 3 will use the regular colorization. | **0** |
| OverrideAlpha | REG_DWORD | When set to 1, colorization alpha specified by DWM is overridden on the taskbar, start menu, and thumbnails. | **0** |
| AlphaValue | REG_DWORD | For use alongside OverrideAlpha, to specify a 2-digit hex code for the colorization system to use. | **0x6B** |
| UseTaskbarPinning | REG_DWORD | Determines whether taskbar pinning functionality is available to the user. When set to 0, pins will not be loaded and cannot be modified from jumplists. | **1** |

## Theme support

explorer7 loads the inactive taskbar/start menu theme from the `Theme` folder next to `explorer.exe`, falling back to the legacy singular `Theme` folder if that is what the package contains. By default it automatically picks the file that matches the active Windows theme, and caches the last detected file in `ThemeCache` so startup can reuse it if Windows has not exposed the active theme yet:

```
explorer.exe folder/
├─ Theme/        (preferred)
│  ├─ aero.msstyles
│  ├─ aerodark.msstyles
│  ├─ aerolite.msstyles
```

If `Theme` is set under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced`, that value overrides the automatic switch. For example, `Theme=custom` loads `Theme\custom.msstyles`, while `Theme=C:\Theme\custom.msstyles` loads that full path directly.

If applicable, you **must** include the "en-US" folder that comes along with your .msstyles file, otherwise the theme won't be applied. Themes from Windows 8.1 and later do work, but will not have the proper classes for the start menu, an issue which cannot currently be resolved.

## Custom orbs

As an additional feature, explorer7 lets you import your own custom orbs without having to patch your explorer.exe using Resource Hacker or using specialized programs. You can do this either with a directory of `.bmp` files under the `orbs` folder, or with a standalone `.orb` PE file that contains the same bitmap resources explorer.exe would normally load. Due to WinGDI limitations, the directory-based format only supports `.bmp` images. If it finds the appropriate images or resources, the orb system will also account for 125% and 150% DPI (HiDPI) automatically. The layout should be as it follows:

<details>
  <summary>Valid layout for custom orbs:</summary>

`OrbDirectory` registry key set to `blue`
```
explorer7/
├─ orbs/
│  ├─ blue/
│  │  ├─ 6801.bmp (100% DPI - 52x162 - Bottom-aligned taskbar image)
│  │  │  6802.bmp (125% DPI - 66x198 - Bottom-aligned taskbar image)
│  │  │  6803.bmp (150% DPI - 81x243 - Bottom-aligned taskbar image)
│  │  │  6804.bmp (190% DPI - 106x318 - Bottom-aligned taskbar image)
│  │  │  6805.bmp (100% DPI - 52x162 - Left/right-aligned taskbar image)
│  │  │  6806.bmp (125% DPI - 66x198 - Left/right-aligned taskbar image)
│  │  │  6807.bmp (150% DPI - 81x243 - Left/right-aligned taskbar image)
│  │  │  6808.bmp (190% DPI - 106x318 - Left/right-aligned taskbar image)
│  │  │  6809.bmp (100% DPI - 52x162 - Top-aligned taskbar image)
│  │  │  6810.bmp (125% DPI - 66x198 - Top-aligned taskbar image)
│  │  │  6811.bmp (150% DPI - 81x243 - Top-aligned taskbar image)
│  │  │  6812.bmp (190% DPI - 106x318 - Top-aligned taskbar image)

```

`OrbDirectory` registry key set to `colors\green`
```
explorer7/
├─ orbs/
│  ├─ colors/
│  │  ├─ green/
│  │  │  ├─ 6801.bmp (100% DPI - 52x162 - Bottom-aligned taskbar image)
│  │  │  │  6802.bmp (125% DPI - 66x198 - Bottom-aligned taskbar image)
│  │  │  │  6803.bmp (150% DPI - 81x243 - Bottom-aligned taskbar image)
│  │  │  │  6804.bmp (190% DPI - 106x318 - Bottom-aligned taskbar image)
│  │  │  │  6805.bmp (100% DPI - 52x162 - Left/right-aligned taskbar image)
│  │  │  │  6806.bmp (125% DPI - 66x198 - Left/right-aligned taskbar image)
│  │  │  │  6807.bmp (150% DPI - 81x243 - Left/right-aligned taskbar image)
│  │  │  │  6808.bmp (190% DPI - 106x318 - Left/right-aligned taskbar image)
│  │  │  │  6809.bmp (100% DPI - 52x162 - Top-aligned taskbar image)
│  │  │  │  6810.bmp (125% DPI - 66x198 - Top-aligned taskbar image)
│  │  │  │  6811.bmp (150% DPI - 81x243 - Top-aligned taskbar image)
│  │  │  │  6812.bmp (190% DPI - 106x318 - Top-aligned taskbar image)

```

You can also point `OrbDirectory` directly at a `.orb` file instead of a directory. Relative values are resolved next to `explorer.exe`, so `OrbDirectory=Windows 7.orb` will load `explorer7\Windows 7.orb`. The file should contain the orb bitmaps as PE resources using the same numeric IDs (`6801`-`6812`) that explorer.exe uses. Missing resource IDs still fall back to the internal explorer.exe orb. When `OrbDirectory` is unset, explorer7 automatically tries `explorer7\orbs\aero.orb` before falling back to the built-in orb.
  
</details>

**NOTE 1:** BE CAREFUL! If the image corresponding to your case DOES NOT exist in your orb directory, it will automatically fall back to the original image inside explorer.exe.

**NOTE 2:** If an image is larger than what the system expects, the image might clip out. Use the example layout as a reference! For more information, you can also check out this guide: https://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/73616-how-create-custom-start-orb-image.html

**NOTE 3:** If you're looking to create high-quality orbs (32-bit bitmaps), you could use a tool to convert your images from other formats. Check out [Pixelformer](https://www.qualibyte.com/pixelformer/).

## Development plan

We're working based on a series of development milestones. Here's the planned development stages as things currently stand:

|   Stage   | Goal | Status |
| -------- | --------- | ------ |
| Milestone 1 | Initial release focused on stability for Windows 8.1, and providing a starting point for Windows 10 support. |  |
| Milestone 2 | - Achieving stability for Windows 10 and 11 (up to and including 23H2) <br> - Ensuring that behaviour on Windows 8.1 perfectly matches its predecessor. <br> - Providing more visually accurate interfaces (e.g. program list) <br> - Supporting older .msstyles <br> - Introducing immersive shell support <br> - Custom orb support | ✅ Completed |
| Milestone 3 | Solving persistent bugs remaining on Windows 10 and 11. Likely to focus more on fixes and adjustments than new features. | ⏳ Work in progress |

While this project is aimed at restoring Windows 7 explorer.exe functionality, some older explorer versions have been found to work with the wrapper. In the future, we plan to support some of these directly.  Here's the chart
for support:

| Version | Status |
| ------- | ------ |
| Windows 7 | ⏳ Work in progress |

## Minhook Linker errors

If you're having linker errors because of the prebuilt minhook, do the following:

- In the root folder, open a cmd and grab the minhook repo: `git clone https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook.git minhook`
- Once it's done, compile the solution in `minhook\build\VC17\MinHookVC17.sln`, specifying x64 Platform. You can do this using Visual Studio.
- Either copy it to the explorerwrapper project folder or just don't do anything and compile. A pre-build task will copy the new version over for you to use.

Contributors: DON'T COMMIT YOUR MODIFIED `libMinHook.x64.lib` UNLESS SPECIFIED!
